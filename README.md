# Haskell Tic Tac Toe

# Prerequisites

In order to run the program, you will need to install the Haskell GHC compiler.

https://www.haskell.org/downloads/

# Getting Started

Start by cloning the project by running the following command:

 `git clone https://github.com/Basekill/haskell-tic-tac-toe.git`

Once in the project directory, start the tic tac toe program by running the command:

`runghc TicTacToe.hs`

Once the command has finished running you should see the following output:

Enter a board size, which can be any positive integer, to initialise the board. As an example we enter `3`.

Make a move by entering a row and column index (separated by a space). As an example we enter `1 0`.

Each player continues making moves until one player wins or we have a draw.

# Modifying the Program

The program can be edited by modifying the `TicTacToe.hs` file.

# Testing

The tests can be run by using the following command:

`runghc Tests.hs`

Extra tests can be added by modifying the `Tests.hs` file.

# Credits

`IC/TestSuite.hs` is the test suite made by Imperial College London.
The Tic Tac Toe program is based off of the skeleton files provided by Imperial College London.
